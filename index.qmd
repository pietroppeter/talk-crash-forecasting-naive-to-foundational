## 👋 Hi, I am Pietro  👨‍👩‍👧

- Data Scientist @ [agilelab.it](agilelab.it) ⚪️🔵
  - 📘[handbook](), 🤙[holacracy]() (self-management)
- (previously) 8+ years at Software Vendor in Supply Chain
- 🐍🇮🇹 Python/PyData Milano [milano.python.it]()
- 🐙 [github.com/pietroppeter](github.com/pietroppeter) (👈 more socials 🔗)

🎪 Come to PyCon Italy (Bologna, May 29-31)! 🍝

## why forecasting?

domains

- 📈 sales/demand
- 🔋 energy consumption
- 💹 financial assets
- 🌤️ weather
- ...

where is the (business) value? 💰

take better decisions! 💡

## 🏹 taking time seriously

time is the most important dimension

- time frequency (months, weeks, days, hours, ...)
- time horizon (how many weeks in the future)?
- lag n forecast: the forecast for the n-th time bucket in the future

other dimensions (e.g. product, market, ...) usually lead
to forecasting _multiple_ time series (or _multivariate_ ones)

## methodology

1. think about your why
2. gather data (process, explore)
3. baseline
4. measure
5. improve
6. restart from step 4 or less

## example 1: AirPassengers

todo

## baseline (options)

- Historical average
- Naive (aka persistence in weather forecasting)
- Moving Average
- Seasonal Naive
- ..., existing forecast (benchmark)

## baseline (code)

todo

## measure (metrics)

todo

## cross validation

## measure (code)

## example 2: M5
